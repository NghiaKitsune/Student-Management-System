## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java Core
* **GUI Framework:** Java Swing (JFrame, JTable)
* **IDE:** NetBeans
* **Data Structure:** ArrayList (Java Collections Framework)
* **Architecture:** Desktop GUI Application (Event-driven programming)

## ✨ Key Features & Algorithms
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** User-friendly interface to manage students without using command lines.
* **Student Management (CRUD):** Add, Update, and Delete students directly via input forms and action buttons.
* **Sorting Algorithm:** Implemented **Insertion Sort** (triggered via "Sort" button) to rank students by GPA.
* **Searching & Filtering:**
    * **Linear Search:** Find students by Name or ID.
    * **Filter:** View students by specific Major (IT, Biz, GD).
* **Real-time Validation:** Validates numeric inputs (Age, Marks) directly on the form.

> **Note:** This project combines **Data Structures (ArrayList)** with **Java Swing GUI**. Data is non-persistent (stored in RAM).
